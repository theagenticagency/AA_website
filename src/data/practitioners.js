    bio: `Prayson didn't start with code. He started with theology and philosophy — and modelled free will with Bayesian probability. The bridge to data science was shorter than it looks.

Now he leads Team _42 at Norlys, Denmark's largest energy company serving 1 million homes. His team operates outside standard SAFe cadence with a mandate from the top: idea to production in under 5 days. 5 projects in 3 weeks. They're not running pilots — they're shipping agent-based systems into live infrastructure.`,

    bio: `Anton is a 26-year-old computational physicist running the AI function at Simply.TV — the Danish B2B firm that supplies TV metadata to operators in roughly sixty countries. His company has just crossed a quietly historic threshold: 99-point-x-percent accuracy, on enough of its features, that the editors have started, for real, to be replaced by software he wrote.

Before Simply.TV, Anton was at Halfspace (acquired by Accenture), advising Nordic enterprises on AI strategy. His master's thesis at University of Copenhagen was on text-to-motion generation. But the defining moment came earlier: a third-year physics project where he met the autoencoder and realized that comprehension and compression are the same thing.`,
